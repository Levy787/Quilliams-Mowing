      "question": "How long does a gravel garden transformation take?",
      "answer": "Most gravel garden projects can be completed in a few days, depending on access, the amount of clearance required, and whether patio works are included. We’ll confirm timings after a site visit or photos."

    {
      "id": "will-weeds-come-through",
      "question": "Will weeds grow through the gravel?",
      "answer": "A properly installed weed membrane and good ground preparation greatly reduces weeds. Some surface weeds can still appear over time (often from wind-blown seeds), but they’re usually quick to remove."

    {
      "id": "how-to-maintain-gravel",
      "question": "How do I maintain a gravel garden?",
      "answer": "Gravel gardens are generally low maintenance. Occasional raking, removing debris, and topping up gravel when needed will keep the area looking sharp."
