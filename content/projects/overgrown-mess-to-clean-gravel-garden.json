      "id": "will-weeds-come-back",
      "question": "Will weeds come back through the gravel?",
      "answer": "Good ground preparation and a proper weed-suppression layer can dramatically reduce weeds. Over time, some surface weeds can still appear from wind-blown seeds, but they’re usually quick to remove and far less work than a traditional bed."

    {
      "id": "how-do-i-maintain",
      "question": "How do I maintain a gravel garden?",
      "answer": "Gravel gardens are easy to maintain: occasional raking, removing leaves/debris, and topping up gravel when needed will keep it looking tidy. If you want, we can also provide an ongoing maintenance plan."
